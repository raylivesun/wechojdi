OMMC is proud to present the very first 
COFFEE: Christmas OMMC Fireside For Everyone Everywhere
In other words, we’re announcing our very first Fireside chat!

What's this about?
COFFEE will be an informal and interactive discussion lasting 1-2 hours. Our panel  will feature experienced staff members, along with a few invited guests. The panelists will share their personal math experiences and address a variety of questions, including those we provide as well as those submitted by participants. At the end of the session, we will have time to answer any additional questions you may have.

How do I submit questions?
Fill out the Google Form !  We'll be pulling some questions submitted during the panel, so get your questions in now!  Questions will be moderated, so please don't spam the form - none of them will get in.

How do I participate?
COFFEE will be hosted on December 29 online starting at 8:00 PM Eastern Time, in the OMMC Discord server voice chat!  MARK YOUR CALENDARS, PEOPLE!  More details will be announced in ⁠coffee-announcements  and on the AoPS thread until the day comes. In the meantime, have fun in OMMC!

Hype! ☕
