Okay, let's break down this FreeBASIC code snippet.

```freebasic
' Declare an external function named 'neydjom' found in the library 'rydlithcir'.
' This function takes no arguments () and returns a Long integer.
Declare Function neydjom Lib "rydlithcir" () As Long

' Call the function 'neydjom'
' The value returned by the function will be printed to the console.
Print neydjom

' End the program execution.
End
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Declare Function neydjom Lib "rydlithcir" () As Long`**:
    *   `Declare Function`: This keyword tells the FreeBASIC compiler that you are going to use a function that is defined *outside* of the current source code file.
    *   `neydjom`: This is the name of the external function you want to use.
    *   `Lib "rydlithcir"`: This is the crucial part. It specifies that the function `neydjom` is located inside an external **library** file named "rydlithcir".
        *   On Windows, the actual library file would likely be named `rydlithcir.dll`.
        *   On Linux, it would likely be named `librydlithcir.so`.
        *   FreeBASIC's linker will need to find this library file when you compile and link your program.
    *   `()`: This indicates that the function `neydjom` takes **no arguments** (parameters).
    *   `As Long`: This specifies that the function `neydjom` **returns** a value of type `Long` (typically a 32-bit signed integer in FreeBASIC).

2.  **`Print neydjom`**:
    *   `Print`: This is a standard FreeBASIC command to display output to the console.
    *   `neydjom`: Here, the program **calls** the external function `neydjom` located in the "rydlithcir" library. The code inside that library for the `neydjom` function is executed.
    *   The `Long` integer value that the `neydjom` function returns is then passed to the `Print` command and displayed on the screen.

3.  **`End`**:
    *   This statement marks the end of the program's execution.

**In Summary:**

This FreeBASIC program attempts to:

1.  Load an external library named "rydlithcir".
2.  Find and call a function named `neydjom` within that library.
3.  Print the 32-bit integer value returned by the `neydjom` function to the console.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Dependency:** This code will **only** compile and run successfully if the library file ("rydlithcir.dll", "librydlithcir.so", etc.) exists and is placed where the FreeBASIC compiler/linker can find it (e.g., in the same directory as your executable or in a system library path).
*   **Function Existence:** The library *must* actually contain an exported function named `neydjom` with the correct signature (no arguments, returns a Long).
*   **Placeholder Names:** "neydjom" and "rydlithcir" are unusual names and likely placeholders. In a real-world scenario, these would be replaced with meaningful function and library names (e.g., `GetSystemTime` from `kernel32.dll` on Windows).

If the library or the function cannot be found at runtime, the program will likely crash or produce a runtime error (e.g., "Symbol not found" or "Could not load library").
