1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user provided a FreeBASIC code snippet similar to the previous one, but with different function and library names.
    *   Function name: `notebooks`
    *   Library name: `ajnoteba`
    *   Function signature: Takes no arguments (`()`) and returns a `Long`.
    *   Action: Calls the function and prints its return value.

2.  **Apply Previous Logic:** The structure and purpose are identical to the `neydjom`/`rydlithcir` example.
    *   `Declare Function`: Declares an external function.
    *   `notebooks`: The name of the function to call.
    *   `Lib "ajnoteba"`: Specifies the external library containing the function.
    *   `() As Long`: Defines the function's parameters (none) and return type (Long).
    *   `Print notebooks`: Calls the declared external function and prints the result.
    *   `End`: Terminates the program.

3.  **Identify Key Points for Explanation:**
    *   Explain each line's purpose (`Declare`, `Lib`, function name, signature, `Print`, `End`).
    *   Emphasize the dependency on the external library (`ajnoteba.dll` or `libajnoteba.so`).
    *   Mention the requirement for the library to actually *contain* the exported `notebooks` function with the correct signature.
    *   Point out that the names seem like placeholders.
    *   Explain the potential runtime errors if the library or function is missing.

4.  **Structure the Explanation:**
    *   Start with the code snippet itself, formatted correctly.
    *   Provide a line-by-line breakdown.
    *   Summarize the overall purpose of the code.
    *   List the important considerations/requirements for the code to work (library existence, function existence, linker path).
    *   Mention potential runtime issues.

5.  **Refine the Language:** Use clear and concise language. Ensure technical terms like "external library," "linker," "exported function," and "signature" are used appropriately. Maintain consistency with the previous explanation's style. Ensure the library file extensions (.dll, .so) are mentioned correctly for different operating systems.
