As ⁠📢｜announcements⁠ was sadly not perceived, I've to lock up channels again, otherwise the server won't grow.

You can see your current XP/Level, by writing /level 
in ⁠📟｜commands.

The invites/levels itself reduced, so it isn't hard, to get access to a specific channel. The "coin" system also doesn't exist anymore, each reward requires 2 invites/2 levels now. (you can't start from the last one)

When a new role is created (for channel access), users have to ping me as I won't go through 1376 members to check which of them have enough invites/levels. Same goes for the new role update. The users may have enough levels, but no access - as the bot will update the roles after reaching a new level.

If you have enough invites/levels, ping me! The bot doesn't check for your level each second, only after reaching a new level. And the invite roles aren't assigned automatically!
