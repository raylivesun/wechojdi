Okay, here is a template for a `README.md` file suitable for a FreeBASIC project. You can copy, paste, and customize this for your specific project.

A brief description of what your project does. What problem does it solve? Who is it for?

## Features

*   List key feature 1
*   List key feature 2
*   Works on [mention supported OS: Windows, Linux, DOS, etc.]
*   ...

## Prerequisites

Before you can build and run this project, you need the following installed:

1.  **FreeBASIC Compiler (fbc):** You can download it from the [official FreeBASIC website](https://www.freebasic.net/get). Ensure `fbc` is in your system's PATH or specify the full path when compiling.
2.  **(Optional) External Libraries:** If your project depends on external libraries (like `.dll` on Windows, `.so` on Linux, or static `.a` files), list them here.
    *   Example: `library_name` (Provide link or source if possible)
    *   Example: `rydlithcir` (From your previous examples - specify where to get it)
    *   Example: `ajnoteba` (From your previous examples - specify where to get it)
3.  **(Optional) Build Tools:** If you use `make` or another build system, mention it. `make`

## Building

Instructions on how to compile the source code.

**Simple Compilation (Single Source File):**

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run:

```bash
fbc your_main_file.bas
```

This will typically create an executable file named `your_main_file.exe` (Windows) or `your_main_file` (Linux/macOS).

**Specifying Output Name:**

```bash
fbc your_main_file.bas -o YourAppName
```
(or `fbc your_main_file.bas -x YourAppName.exe` on Windows)

**Compiling Multiple Source Files:**

If your project is split into multiple `.bas` or `.bi` files:

```bash
fbc main.bas module1.bas module2.bas -o YourAppName
```

**Linking External Libraries:**

If your project uses external shared libraries (`.dll`, `.so`) or static libraries (`.a`):

*   **Shared Libraries (.dll/.so):** Ensure the library file (e.g., `rydlithcir.dll` or `librydlithcir.so`) is located where the operating system can find it at runtime (e.g., in the same directory as your executable, or in a system library path). The `Declare Lib` statement in your code tells FreeBASIC about it. Sometimes, no extra compile flags are needed if only `Declare Lib` is used.
*   **Static Libraries (.a):** You often need to tell the linker about static libraries using the `-l` flag (note: typically, you omit the `lib` prefix and the `.a` extension). You might also need `-p` to specify the path to the library.

   ```bash
   # Example linking 'libmylib.a' on Linux/macOS
   fbc your_main_file.bas -l mylib

   # Example linking 'mylib.lib' (often equivalent to .a) on Windows
   fbc your_main_file.bas -l mylib

   # Example specifying library path
   fbc your_main_file.bas -p /path/to/libs -l mylib
   ```

*   **(Using Make):** If a `Makefile` is provided:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

## Usage

How to run the compiled application.

1.  Navigate to the directory containing the compiled executable.
2.  Run the program:

    *   On Windows:
        ```cmd
        YourAppName.exe [arguments]
        ```
    *   On Linux/macOS:
        ```bash
        ./YourAppName [arguments]
        ```

Provide examples of command-line arguments if your application accepts any.

```bash
# Example:
./YourAppName --input data.txt --output results.log
```

## Examples

(Optional) Provide simple code snippets or usage scenarios demonstrating how to use the project if it's a library, or showcasing the program's functionality.

```freebasic
' Example using a function from this project (if it's a library)
#include "your_library.bi"

Dim result As Long
result = MyFunction(10, 20)
Print "Result:", result

End
```
